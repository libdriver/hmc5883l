## LibDriver HMC5883L

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/hmc5883l/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The Honeywell HMC5883L is a surface-mount, multi-chip module designed for low-field magnetic sensing with a digital interface for applications such as low-cost compassing and magnetometry. The HMC5883L includes our state-of-the-art, high-resolution HMC118X series magneto-resistive sensors plus an ASIC containing amplification, automatic degaussing strap drivers, offset cancellation, and a 12-bit ADC that enables 1° to 2° compass heading accuracy. The I2C serial bus allows for easy interface. The HMC5883L is a 3.0x3.0x0.9mm surface mount 16-pin leadless chip carrier (LCC). Applications for the HMC5883L include Mobile Phones, Netbooks, Consumer Electronics, Auto Navigation Systems, and Personal Navigation Devices.

LibDriver HMC5883L is a full-featured driver of HMC5883L launched by LibDriver.It provides continuous mode magnetic field strength reading, single mode magnetic field reading and other functions. LibDriver complies with MISRA.

### Instruction

/src includes LibDriver HMC5883L source files.

/interface includes LibDriver HMC5883L IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver HMC5883L driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver HMC5883L sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver HMC5883L offline document.

/datasheet includes HMC5883L datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_hmc5883l_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float m_gauss[3];

res = hmc5883l_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...


for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    hmc5883l_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = hmc5883l_basic_read((float *)m_gauss);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)hmc5883l_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    hmc5883l_interface_debug_print("hmc5883l: x is %0.3f.\n", m_gauss[0]);
    hmc5883l_interface_debug_print("hmc5883l: y is %0.3f.\n", m_gauss[1]);
    hmc5883l_interface_debug_print("hmc5883l: z is %0.3f.\n", m_gauss[2]);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)hmc5883l_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```

#### example shot

```C
#include "driver_hmc5883l_shot.h"

uint8_t res;
uint8_t i;
float m_gauss[3];

res = hmc5883l_shot_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...

for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    hmc5883l_interface_delay_ms(1000);
    res = hmc5883l_shot_read((float *)m_gauss);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)hmc5883l_shot_deinit();

        return 1;
    }
    hmc5883l_interface_debug_print("hmc5883l: x is %0.3f.\n", m_gauss[0]);
    hmc5883l_interface_debug_print("hmc5883l: y is %0.3f.\n", m_gauss[1]);
    hmc5883l_interface_debug_print("hmc5883l: z is %0.3f.\n", m_gauss[2]);
    
    ...
    
}

...

(void)hmc5883l_shot_deinit();

return 0;
```
